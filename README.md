Original Intention:

Suppose that I am interested in the area of Android development. I like to browse and answer Stack Overflow questions that are related to Android. However, it is tedious to search for the relevant questions on Stack Overflow. 

I would like to see the titles of the 10 newest Android-related questions and the 10 most voted Android-related questions posted in the past week, on one page. In this way, I can easily keep track of the relevant questions. In addition, I would like to be able to read the full information of these questions in a convenient way. 

Requirements: 
A. Extracting from stackoverflow.com the 10 newest Android-related questions, as well as the 10 most voted Android-related questions are created in the past week. 
B. Providing a convenient way of displaying the full question thread after I click on the titles. 
C. Adding a cool feature.
